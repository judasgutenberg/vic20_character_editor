# vic20_character_editor

This is the reconstruction of a character editor tool I wrote in VIC-20 BASIC.

This ran in 3 kilobytes of RAM (a stock VIC-20) and had a number of Photoshop-like features for editing any character in a character set.
Each character was an eight by eight monochrome grid of pixels. I was sixteen when I wrote this in 1984.

The code has been migrated to a .txt file and then to a .bas file (which has my latest understanding of the code), but I am still trying to figure out how to migrate Commodore's proprietary control codes so the UI will work correctly.  These codes were represented in arbitrary hard-to-discern symbols by the Commodore 1520 plotter that I used to originally print the code listing back in 1984.

Also:  CBM's version of "^" (which means "raise to the power of" in BASIC) seems to have been turned into "Ï€" by the plotter I used to print my code listing.

It looks like this could come in handy:

I think I might have a couple broken VIC-20s in the attic back at my childhood home in Virginia. There's also most of a C-128.

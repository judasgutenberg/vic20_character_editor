# vic20_character_editor

This is the reconstruction of a character editor tool I wrote in VIC-20 BASIC.

This ran in 3 kilobytes of RAM (stock VIC-20) and had a number of Photoshop-like features for editing any character in a character set.
Each character was an eight by eight monochrome grid of pixels. I was sixteen when I wrote this in 1984.

The code has been migrated to a .txt file, but I am still trying to figure out how to migrate Commodore's proprietary control codes so the UI will work correctly.  These codes were represented in arbitrary hard-to-discern symbols by the Commodore 1520 plotter that I used to originally print the code listing back in 1984.

The biggest problem with the restoration of this code is the non-standard ASCII additions Commodore made to its character set, and the shoddy way these were represented in the listing of the code in the old printout.

It looks like this could come in handy:

I think I might have a couple broken VIC-20s in the attic back at my childhood home in Virginia. There's also most of a C-128.

# vic20_character_editor

This is the reconstruction of a character editor tool I wrote in VIC-20 BASIC.

This ran in 3 kilobytes of RAM (stock VIC-20) and had a number of Photoshop-like features for editing any character in a character set.
Each character was an eight by eight monochrome grid of pixels. I was sixteen when I wrote this in 1984.

The code has been migrated to a .txt file, but I am still trying to figure out how to migrate Commodore's proprietary control codes so the UI will work correctly.  These codes were represented in arbitrary hard-to-discern symbols by the Commodore 1520 plotter that I used to originally print the code listing back in 1984.

It looks like this could come in handy:

# vic20_character_editor
reconstruction of a character editor tool I wrote back in 1984 in VIC-20 BASIC

This ran in 3 kilobytes of RAM (stock VIC-20) and had a number of Photoshop-like features for editing any character in a character set.
Each character was an eight by eight monochrome grid of pixels. I was sixteen when I wrote this in 1984.
